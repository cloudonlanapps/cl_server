# Tests for [Package Name]

This directory contains the test suite for [package description]. The tests are written using `pytest` and cover [key areas tested].

[Optional: Only if package has both unit and integration tests]
## Overview & Structure

The test suite is organized into two categories:

- **Unit tests** (`test_*.py`) — [Description, e.g., "Test individual components with mocked dependencies"]
- **Integration tests** (`test_integration/`) — [Description, e.g., "Test against live services"]

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- Dependencies installed via `uv sync`
- [Other prerequisites like running services, test media files, etc.]

**Note:** With uv, you don't need to manually create or activate virtual environments. Use `uv run` to execute commands in the automatically managed environment.

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests

To run the entire test suite with coverage:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

**Coverage requirement:** [X]% (configured in `pyproject.toml`)

### Run Specific Test Files

To run tests from a specific file:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_file1.py -v
uv run pytest tests/test_file2.py -v
```

### Run Individual Tests

To run a specific test function:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_file.py::test_function_name -v

# Or specific test in a class
uv run pytest tests/test_file.py::TestClassName::test_method_name -v
```

### Coverage Options

**Default behavior:** Coverage is automatically collected with HTML + terminal reports and requires ≥[X]% coverage.

```bash
# Run tests with coverage (generates htmlcov/ directory + terminal report)
uv run pytest

# Skip coverage for quick testing
uv run pytest --no-cov

# Override coverage threshold (e.g., for debugging)
uv run pytest --cov-fail-under=0
```

Coverage reports are saved to `htmlcov/index.html` - open this file in a browser to view detailed coverage.

## Test Organization

[If unit and integration tests are separated, document the structure]

### Unit Tests

[Description of unit tests]

```
test_file1.py                    # [Description] ([N] tests)
  TestClass1                     # [Description] ([N] tests)
    - test_feature1
    - test_feature2
  TestClass2                     # [Description]
    - test_feature3
```

### Integration Tests

[Description of integration tests]

```
test_integration/
  test_integration_file.py       # [Description] ([N] tests)
  conftest.py                    # Integration test fixtures
  README.md                      # Integration test documentation
```

## Test Structure

The tests are organized into the following files:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tests/test_file1.py` | [Description of what this file tests] |
| `tests/test_file2.py` | [Description] |
| `tests/test_file3.py` | [Description] |
| `tests/conftest.py` | Pytest fixtures for [fixtures provided] |

## [Optional: Service Requirements]

[If tests require running services]

Integration tests require **running services**:

```
Service 1:    http://localhost:[PORT]
Service 2:    http://localhost:[PORT]
```

### Starting Services

[Brief instructions or reference to how to start services]

## [Optional: Test Media / Special Setup]

[If tests require test media files or special configuration]

## [Optional: Test Details]

[Detailed breakdown of what each test file/class covers - use only if valuable]

## Configuration

The test configuration is defined in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`:
- **Test Paths**: `tests`
- **Coverage**: Automatically enabled with HTML + terminal reports
- **Coverage Threshold**: [X]% minimum (tests fail if below)
- **Markers**: [List any custom pytest markers, e.g., `integration`]

## [Optional: Troubleshooting]

### [Common Issue 1]

[Solution]

```bash
# Example fix
command-to-fix
```
